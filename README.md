# Do-you-share-coming-out-stories-still

This entry contains a Max/MSP patch, TouchKeys preset and Ableton set for Do you share coming out stories still? by Robert Reid Allan. 
The TouchKeys present pairs with the Ableton set to facilitate pitch-bends and vibrato using a TouchKeys keyboard. 
The Max/MSP patch runs separately, and triggers video samples in response to the depressing of selected chords.
